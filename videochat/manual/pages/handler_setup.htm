        Handlers Setup</h1>
      <p>Flashcoms products do not come with pre-built users&#39; database as it was 
        specifically designed to be integrated into existing website authentication 
        mechanism and profile system. In case you don&#39;t have registration system on your 
        website and need chat to work under integrated mode you may consider installing 
        our free user&#39;s system which has basic attributes of a website and can be 
        downloaded from your support area. </p>
        <p>At this step we're configuring the path to authorization handler thus making 
            Chat Server aware of where to turn to for user's data. At the very 
            beginning of our installation guide we have reviewed structure of Chat's 
            archive and copied all files to pre-created folder which is "chat71" with 
            corresponding HTTP path as &quot; <a href="http://your-domain.com/messenger7/">
            http://yourdomain/chat71/</a> &quot;</p>
        <p>A handler is a server script, that returns data (usually in XML format) to the 
            application upon request. For example, it can return user profile information or 
            user authorization information.</p>
        <p><b>1.</b> Open admin console using default login : admin / admin (Be sure to 
            change login at the first time use to prevent unauthorized access)
            <a href="http://your-domain.com/messenger7/admin/admin.html">
            http://yourdomain/chat71/admin/admin.htm</a></p>
        <p>
            <b>2. </b>Go to Handlers section and specify corresponding path to handlers:</p>
