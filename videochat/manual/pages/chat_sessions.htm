        Chat Sessions</h1>
    <p>With the help of &quot;Sessions&quot; table in Admin Panel you are able to monitor all 
        currently active sessions. User1 and User2 fields stand for the names of two 
        opponents. </p>
        <p>&quot;Started&quot; field fixes time, when both users opened messenger windows for 
            conversation. Overall time of current session is stored in &quot;Duration&quot; column. 
            You may forcibly close certain session by clicking on &quot;Close&quot; button in 
            &quot;Actions&quot; column. </p>
        <p>Note, that only session between two selected users will be shut down. If any of 
            the opponents has another active session with different user - it will not be 
            affected.</p>
