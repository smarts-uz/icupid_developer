        <p><b>1.</b> Once  loaded Chat sends a request over TCP to chat server. The request contains UID  parameter to be used for further authentication. </p>
        <p><b>2.</b> Java  Server makes HTTP call to handler located on web server (your website). </p>
        <p><b>3.</b> Handler  generates XML formatted response containing all user's profile data and returns  output xml back to java server. </p>
        <p><b>4. </b>Chat  receives full information about the user. In case authentication fails for the  user and step #3 returns corresponding error, a warning window appears with  notification for the user. </p>
        <p>In the following sections we will cover each step in more detail. </p>
