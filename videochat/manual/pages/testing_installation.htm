    <p>In the preceding steps we have been preparing application for the first-time run 
        in fully working mode: </p>
        <p><b>1.</b> Go to any page of your website with embedded presence code 
            (JS and Presence pixel setup-&gt; step# 2) </p>
        <p><b>2.</b> Open admin console (Handler Setup - &gt; step# 1) </p>
        <p><b>3.</b> Select "User online" tab and you should see our random user listed:</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" src="img/messenger7/users_online.png" /></p>
    <p>The above indicates all steps have been performed successfully and application is 
        ready for further integration and deployment. In case online list is empty, go 
        through "Installation" and "Basic integration" steps once again, also visit 
        "Troubleshooting" section of the manual. </p>
